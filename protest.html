    <h2>TIPS FOR SAFELY PROTESTING</h2>
      <p>Be sure you are prepared for when you are onsite and protesting. Be safe. Change the world!</p>
    <h3>Preparation:</h3>
        <b>Weather & Dress:</b> Check the forecast and layer appropriately. Wear a mask if privacy is a concern.<br>
        <b>Hydrated & Charged:</b> Keep your phone fully charged and bring a battery extender.<br>
        <b>System:</b> Attend with a friend or let someone know your plans if attending alone.<br>
        <b>De-escalation:</b> Stay calm, avoid provocative behavior, and walk away if needed.<br>
      <br>
    <h3>White Allies’ Roles:</h3>
        <b>Protection:</b> Act as a barrier between marginalized protesters and potential aggressors (e.g., police or counter-protesters).<br>
        <b>Amplify Voices:</b> Listen more than you speak and ensure marginalized voices are heard.<br>
        <b>Support Leaders of Color:</b> Follow the direction of leaders from marginalized communities and avoid taking the lead.<br>
    <br>
    <h3>Safety at the Protest:</h3>
        <b>Stay Vigilant: </b>Be aware of your surroundings, avoid engaging with counter-protesters, and assist others if needed.<br>
        <b>Expect Law Enforcement Interaction:</b> Stay calm, keep hands visible, and don't argue with the police. Know your rights and document interactions.<br>
        <b>Dispersal Orders: </b>If a dispersal order is given, comply or face potential arrest. Police must provide a reasonable opportunity to disperse and explain the order.<br>
    <br>
    <h3>Know Your Rights:</h3>
        <b>Documentation:</b>You can record police actions, including arrests and excessive force. Police cannot seize your phone or delete your photos without a warrant.<br>
        <b>Arrest Protocol:</b> If arrested, you must be informed of the reason, and you have the right to a lawyer and phone call.<br>
        <b>Searches: </b>You are not required to consent to searches without a warrant, and police cannot delete your recordings.<br>
    <br>
    This guide emphasizes personal safety, respect for organizers, and understanding legal rights during protests. It's crucial to stay aware of the situation and prioritize peaceful action and protection for all involved.
